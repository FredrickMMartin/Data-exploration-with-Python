# Data-exploration-with-Python

This is a project that I am currently working on under suprevision from my mentor. 

### General project goals
The overall goals of the project were to:

1. apply data wrangling and cleaning techniques to the data
2. identify a set of questions that the data can be used to explore  
3. complete explanatory and exploratory analysis
4. create a succinct and effective visual presentation of your findngs

### Uploaded Material
My work to date for this project is uploaded here. 
The 'Requirement ...' headings used in the document correspond to specific requirements set for the project and these numbers in no way relate to the general project goals above. 

### Missing files
The file cleaner_df.csv was too large to be uploaded to GitHub. 
This file is created by running the Req_3_4 file so there should be no problem as long as this is run before Req_5_6_7.

### Comments
